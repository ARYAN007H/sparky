//! The system prompt a resumed thread is sent.
//!
//! A resumed thread's prefix is frozen: the runtime restores the system
//! messages its transcript recorded and sends them verbatim, which keeps the
//! provider's prefix cache warm across a restart. A turn can still offer a
//! replacement, which the runtime applies only when it differs from what is
//! recorded; a thread-bound session then seals the transcript generation it
//! was on and carries its conversation into the next. Two things offer one:
//!
//! - the permanent-tool catalogue (`permanent.rs`), whenever it changes;
//! - the whole prompt, rendered afresh, when the agent's definition sets
//!   `refresh_prompt_on_resume`, so prompt edits reach existing threads too.
//!
//! Whatever is offered, the turn's transcript snapshot boundary moves with
//! it: the request starts with the offered prefix, not the recorded one.
//!
//! When the whole prompt is replaced, the user's message on that turn opens
//! with a one-time note saying so (`PROMPT_UPDATE_NOTE`). The conversation
//! before it was written under the old prompt, and a model keeps to what it
//! already said there (that something is "coming soon", say) over
//! instructions that changed since.
